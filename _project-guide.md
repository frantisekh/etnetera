Coding Task Assignment
The task is to create a functional HTML page according to the provided design, see file @design.png

It is necessary to meet the following conditions:

- the page should be responsive
- the page should meet basic validity and accessibility rules
- the use of large CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.) is allowed with discretion (we leave it up to you)

The assignment only contains a basic definition of active states (:hover, :active, etc.). Their implementation is left to your discretion. The responsive design is intentionally not defined - we want to know how you will handle it, apply your creativity. The PSD contains everything needed to complete the task. It's up to you whether you want to use a CSS preprocessor, a bundling tool - in this regard, you have freedom, just always provide the source files and don't forget to send the compiled result. On the other hand, JS frameworks like React, Vue, etc. are not allowed for this task. We want to go through the HTML code of the rendered page line by line, look at it in the developer console, etc.

We're not playing pixel-perfect, it's important that everything fits nicely and never breaks (including mobile and tablet devices and the latest versions of commonly used browsers).

The page contains several dynamic elements - carousel, graph, tooltip, button with a form, and menu. It's again up to you whether you will use an already-made library, write everything custom using, for example, jQuery, or write everything just in pure JavaScript - in any case, it's necessary to ensure compatibility between browsers.

You will also get extra points from us if you show knowledge of some methodology (BEM, atomic design, etc.), an interesting tool/library, HTML5/CSS3 specification, or advanced accessibility methods. We will also be interested in how well the page is prepared from the front-end performance perspective.

Good luck!
